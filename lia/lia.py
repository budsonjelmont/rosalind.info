# Problem
# Figure 2. The probability of each outcome for the sum of the values on two rolled dice (black and white),
# broken down depending on the number of pips showing on each die. You can verify that 18 of the 36 equally probable
# possibilities result in an odd sum.

# Two events A
# and B are independent if Pr(A and B) is equal to Pr(A)×Pr(B). In other words, the events do not influence each other,
# so that we may simply calculate each of the individual probabilities separately and then multiply.
# More generally, random variables X and Y are independent if whenever A and B are respective events for X and Y,
# A and B are independent (i.e., Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)×Pr(B)).

# As an example of how helpful independence can be for calculating probabilities, let X
# and Y represent the numbers showing on two six-sided dice. Intuitively, the number of pips showing on one die
# should not affect the number showing on the other die. If we want to find the probability that X+Y is odd, then
# we don't need to draw a tree diagram and consider all possibilities. We simply first note that for X+Y to be odd,
# either X is even and Y is odd or X is odd and Y is even. In terms of probability, Pr(X+Y is odd)=Pr(X is even and Y
# is odd)+Pr(X is odd and Y is even). Using independence, this becomes [Pr(X is even)×Pr(Y is odd)]+[Pr(X is odd)×Pr(Y is even)],
# or (12)2+(12)2=12. You can verify this result in Figure 2, which shows all 36 outcomes for rolling two dice.

# Given: Two positive integers k
# (k≤7) and N (N≤2k). In this problem, we begin with Tom, who in the 0th generation has genotype Aa Bb. Tom has two children
# in the 1st generation, each of whom has two children, and so on. Each organism always mates with an organism having genotype Aa Bb.

# Return: The probability that at least N Aa Bb organisms will belong to the k-th generation of Tom's family tree
# (don't count the Aa Bb mates at each level). Assume that Mendel's second law holds for the factors.
