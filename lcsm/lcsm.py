# Problem

# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. 
# We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. 
# For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; 
# in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

# Given: A collection of k
# (kâ‰¤100

# ) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
